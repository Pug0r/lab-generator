# lab-generator
Project for Uni class on algorithms and data structures, written in C# because I have way too much free time. 
Turns out it's a nice language though.

It generates a simple maze using a DFS-based algorithms, translated into cell logic. 
User can choose complexity (number of cells) to fit their intellectual capabilities (mine fall short after complexity set to 10).
